title: Using Computer Modeling to Understand Memory
---

Associative memory, according to Dr. Wendy Suzuki, is "defined as the ability to learn and remember the relationship between unrelated items such as the name of someone we have just met or the aroma of a particular perfume". For years, neuroscientists have known that memories are encoded in our brain through what are called excitatory cell assemblies. These assemblies, called engrams, are connections of cells that often fire in conjunction with one another, which could be analogous to our human perception that our memories are "triggered" by certain stimuli. 
Recently though, researchers at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Okinawa, Japan discovered that computer models of human brains had a stark improvement in associative memory once they implemented digitized engrams that are opposite from the excitatory assemblies that create memories. 
These "inhibitory" engrams are important for our brain's function, because they reduce the likelihood of certain synapses firing. As a result, our memories are more likely to resign themselves to latent and quiescent forms until the appropriate context.
Using circuits to model excitatory engrams (a fancy way of saying that they created circuits that fire in conjunction with one another), the team was able to replicate function similar to a human brain. 
Studying the brain in this way can teach us a few things, as Helen C. Barron puts it, "Understanding mechanisms that regulate the formation and expression of inhibitory engrams in vivo may help not only to explain key features of cognition but also to provide insight into transdiagnostic traits associated with psychiatric conditions such as autism, schizophrenia, and posttraumatic stress disorder." What the team found was that the models were able to remember "patterns spanning a longer duration" when they implemented the inhibitory circuits.

The inhibitory circuits were able to block stimuli from meddling with the excitatory circuits, which means that those circuits worked better in conjunction with one another, leading to the increased performance. Scientists believe that a brain with a balance of these excitatory and inhibitory neurons will be optimized for the best memory-recall ability, because it won't focus on unimportant patterns, but the brain will also have a detailed memory of what it does in fact choose to familiarize itself with.
Once teams are effectively able to replicate the models of Fukai and his team, it will open the door to better research on the hippocampus and general cognitive function. The processing of this information, as well as the set-up of the circuits themselves, is very intensive on computers and so there are some technical roadblocks to further reviewing the team's discoveries. But, the team hasn’t even implemented full dendrites in their models yet, and so we can look forward to even further innovation in this field. Get excited for the future of our understanding of memory, because the growth rate of our knowledge is probably going to start accelerating, and often fatal afflictions like Alzheimer's, dementia, etc. might see their end in time.
