title: How Neural Networks Can Change Medicine
---

Despite the increase of funds, doctors, and nurses that are being dedicated towards the medical industry, key measures of patient-success have regressed. For the 4th year in a row, life expectancies have decreased, and major misdiagnoses have increased due to the huge influx of patients seeking medical care. Quite clearly, the increased amount of employed doctors and nurses have not produced the medical results that we have expected, and we need additional technologies to leverage our under-used medical talents.

The structural problems facing the medical industry - like the lack of funding and the shortage of qualified doctors - could be resolved by Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically "neural networks". These networks are used in everything from machine-learning to sports predictions, and they have a potential use in the medical imaging field, where there is an abundance of patient data from X-rays. These networks can process thousands of images to identify patterns in patients, and these results can be used to diagnose patients. 

A neural network is designed to function similar to a human brain in some respects. The brain inside a human is composed of billions of neurons that transmit signals to each other. In a neural network, the "nodes" function in a similar way. For medical applications, a computer would be "fed" data that pertains to a specific illness or problem and then analyze it using the web of interconnected nodes. 

The nodes all independently have a "weight" associated with them that is applied to each data point that the nodes receive. This weight is essentially a way to tell how important certain data is. At first, all of these weights are chosen randomly, but as the overall network gets fed more and more data, the individual weight of nodes becomes more and more accurate through trial and error. 

When a node receives a signal from a previous node, it then uses its weight on the signal for the next node, which sends it on to the next, and so on. This process is happening with many different nodes simultaneously, and the end result is a number that is above or below a certain threshold. In other words, the neural network created an output that can be interpreted by a human.
If one pictures how the human brain operates, the process becomes much clearer. A brain receives several different stimuli through our senses, and quickly makes a decision on which stimulus is the most important. Instead of the brain's organic decision making, the completed neural network uses the weights that the nodes possess in order to understand the data. In this way, the network is able to make an informed decision, depending on the intended use for the network.

Because of this innovation, scientists and doctors can make significant strides in many different fields of medicine. Teaching a computer the signs of a serious illness or debilitating disease might allow it to warn patients before it gets too late. This could theoretically be used to identify pre-symptomatic aspects of mental illnesses like Alzheimer's and reduce its effects on the affected individual.

Surprisingly, these AI technologies have reached similar success rates to radiologists - where an abundance of data to input ensures the accuracy and efficiency of these technologies. According to one study, a "neural network" was able to identify cancers more accurately than four radiologists, and the accuracy of these networks is only increasing. The potential medical applications of neural networks are seemingly endless. As an example, so called "convolutional" neural networks recently have been able to quickly identify retinopathy and metastasis of cancer, potentially saving the lives of many people.

More distantly in the future, artificial intelligence may be used for alleviation of depression and anxiety symptoms. The privacy of not talking to a real person might be appealing to those who wish to remain more secretive about their condition. Mental health issues are heavily stigmatized, and so talking to something nonhuman might be part of the solution to our current crisis of health. This would have to be far in the future, though, but itâ€™s not out of our reach. We are making incredible progress as a species in developing these machines, and it certainly seems possible.

Eventually, we might be able to alleviate some of the demands of being a doctor with increasingly capable artificial intelligence. With automation being able to replace some aspects of their job, they would have more time to focus on more important, or necessarily human, bonafide requirements of being a doctor.
