  This is the blog I'll use to keep people updated on the meta-analysis of research that I do, or where I'll post updates on projects that I am working on. I hope it serves as a resource to anyone who can make use of it!

## About Me

I am a student at New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois. In my free time I like to code, pursue my interests in cybersecurity, debate, play video games, work out, and more. My business email is tom.serrino@gmail.com , if anyone wants to contact me.
